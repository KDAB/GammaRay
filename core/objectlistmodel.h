 * NOTE: Making the model itself threadsafe works in theory,
 * but as soon as we put a proxymodel on top everything breaks.
 * Esp. the {begin,end}{InsertRemove}Rows() calls trigger
 * signals which apparently must be delivered directly to the proxy,
 * otherwise it's internal state may be messed up and assertions
 * start flying around...
 * So the solution: only call these methods in the main thread
 * and on remove. when called from a background thread, invalidate
 * the data first.
