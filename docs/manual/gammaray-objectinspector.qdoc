    \title Object Inspector

    \section1 Overview

    The object inspector provides access to all QObject instances in a target. On the left side you have a tree view showing their parent/child relationship,
    on the right side you have access to properties of the selected object.

    Depending on the type of the object, the property view provides additional tabs for accessing specific details of an object.

    The inspector provides the following information about the selected object:

    \list
        \li Properties that are accessible via the Qt introspection system.
        \li Qt signals, including the ability to monitor them for emission.
        \li Qt slots and Q_INVOKABLE methods, including the ability to invoke them.
        \li Inbound and outbound signal/slot connections.
        \li Enums, flags, and class information registered at Qt's meta-object system.
        \li For objects created in a QML context, access to context properties and the current context chain is provided.
    \endlist

    \section1 Finding and Navigating Objects

    Finding objects can be done using the search field on the top-left side of the object inspector. Additionally, visual elements can be picked
    in the target application by holding the Ctrl+Shift+Left keys.

    If you have already selected an object and want to navigate to related objects, such as look at a model of a selected view, you
    can use the object navigation in the context menu by right-clicking on the corresponding element in the property view.

    \section1 Examples

    The following examples make use of the QObject inspector:
    \list
        \li \l{signal-slot}
    \endlist
