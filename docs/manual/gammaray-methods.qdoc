    \title Methods

    \section1 Overview

    The methods view is available for all QObject and QMetaObject instances and shows methods, signals and slots declared in there.

    The methods view contains four columns:
    \list
        \li The signature of the method, including its name and as far as the information is available, its return type and the
            types and names of its arguments.
        \li The method type, that is signal, slot or a Q_INVOKABLE method.
        \li The access type of the method.
        \li The source of the method, which normally is the class it is declared in.
    \endlist

    For some methods, additional information provided via QMetaMethod are available in a tooltip. A warning icon in the method
    name column indicates possible issues detected by GammaRay.

    \section2 Invoking Methods

    Methods can also be dynamically invoked, using the \uicontrol{Invoke} action from the context menu. Similarly, you can emit
    signals by using the \uicontrol{Emit} action from the context menu. In both cases the method invocation dialog shown below
    is displayed.

    In the method invocation dialog you can specify any argument the method or signal may take, the types as in the \l{Properties}
    view are supported here too. You can also specify whether to invoke the method directly or queued.

    \section2 Monitoring Signals

    It is also possible to monitor specific signals of the current QObject, by using the \uicontrol{Connect to} action in the context
    menu of the corresponding signal.

    Whenever the signal is emitted, the signal log at the bottom of the methods view shows the time stamp of the emission, as well as
    the values of the signal arguments, if any. This can also be seen in the above screenshot.

    \section1 Examples

    The following examples make use of the methods view:
    \list
        \li \l{signal-slot}
        \li \l{timer}
    \endlist
