    \title Connections

    \section1 Overview

    The connections view is available for all QObject instances and shows inbound and outbound signal/slot connections for
    the currently selected object.

    The connections view consists of two identical parts. The upper half is showing inbound connections, that is signals
    connected to slots of the current objects. The lower half is showing outbound connections, that is signals of the
    current object connected to other slots or arbitrary functions or lambda expressions. The latter is displayed as "slot object".

    Each of the two connection views has four columns:
    \list
        \li The sender object (inbound only), or the receiver object (outbound only).
        \li The name of the signal that is connected.
        \li The name of the slot the signal is connected to, if available.
        \li The type of the connection (automatic, direct or queued).
    \endlist

    \section2 Navigation

    The context menu on both the inbound and outbound connections view allows you to navigate to the sender or receiver object
    respectively.

    \section2 Warnings

    A warning icon is displayed in the first column of the inbound and outbound connections view if GammaRay detected a
    possible issue with the connection, such as:

    \list
        \li The connection exists multiple times.
        \li The connection is explicitly set to direct mode, but the sender and receiver are in different threads.
    \endlist

    Note that these are merely warnings about common problems, but can in some cases actually be valid usage.

    \section1 Examples

    The following examples make use of the connections view:
    \list
        \li \l{signal-slot}
        \li \l{timer}
    \endlist
