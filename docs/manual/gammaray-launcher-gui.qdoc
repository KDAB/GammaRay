    \title Graphical Launcher

    \section1 Overview

    The graphical launcher of allows you to connect GammaRay to a target in application in three different ways:

    \list
        \li Launch a new target application, with GammaRay injected right from the start.
        \li Attach to a locally running application that has already been started by other means.
        \li Connect to a remotely running target that has already been injected by GammaRay by other means.
    \endlist

    The graphical launcher can be started as follows:

    \list
        \li On Windows, by starting gammaray.exe without arguments, or by selecting "GammaRay" from the \uicontrol Start menu.
        \li On Mac OSX , by running the GammaRay app bundle.
        \li On Linux, by running "gammaray" without arguments on the command line, or by selecting "GammaRay" from the start menu.
    \endlist

    \section1 Launching Applications

    The \uicontrol Launch tab of the graphical launcher allows you to start new applications and inject GammaRay into them.
    You just have to select an applcation from the list at the top, and specify command line arguments in the field
    below.

    GammaRay automatically selects the best matching probe for the target application. You can verify this in
    the combo box at the bottom of the page. If GammaRay could not find a compatible probe, launching fails.

    \section1 Attaching to an Application

    The \uicontrol Attach tab of the graphical launcher allows you to attach to an application that is already running, and
    inject GammaRay into it.

    The process list shows all local Qt-based processes that are potential targets. For each of them, GammaRay tries
    to determine the exact Qt version they are using and list only those that has a compatible probe available.

    A tooltip in the process list shows detailed information about the Qt version and used probe for each process.

    \section1 Connecting to a Remote Target

    The \uicontrol Connect tab of the graphical launcher allows you to connect to a target on a remote device that has already
    been injected with GammaRay. This is mainly useful when working with embedded devices.

    GammaRay tries to automatically discover viable targets on your local network, these are displayed in the list view
    on the \uicontrol Connect page, and can be used by selecting the corresponding items. Discovered targets using an incompatible
    GammaRay version will be shown but will be disabled for selection.

    Should GammaRay not be able to discover the desired target automatically, the network address of the target can also
    be specified manually in the entry field on the top. This might be necessary depending on your local network setup.

    \section1 Troubleshooting

    Opening the \uicontrol{Self Test} tab makes GammaRay verify its installation and identify problems (if any). The results are
    displayed on this page.
