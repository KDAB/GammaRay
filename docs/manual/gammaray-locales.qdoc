    \title Locales

    \section1 Overview

    The locale browser is allowing you to inspect the details of every QLocale configuration present on the target system. Thi information is usually independent of the
    target application, but rather depend on the system.

    The upper area allows to select the aspects of the locales you are interested in (for example, date/time settings, currency-related information, number formatting rules, and so on).
    This translates to columns in the table below. Each row in the lower section of the locale browser corresponds with a QLocale configuration present on the target system
    (that is. typically one per country/region). You can use the filter on top to quickly find the country/region you are interested in.
