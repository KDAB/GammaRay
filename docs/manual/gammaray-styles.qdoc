    \section1 Overview

    The Styles tool is used for working on and debugging custom QStyle sub-classes.

    \borderedimage gammaray-style-controls.png

    This tool allows you to look at:

    \list
        \li style primitives in all states,
        \li controls in all states,
        \li complex controls and their sub-element areas,
        \li built-in standard pixmaps,
        \li and the style-defined QPalette.
    \endlist
    
    It also lets you view and edit style pixel metrics.
