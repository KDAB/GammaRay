    \title System Information

    \section1 Overview

    The system information view shows a number of information about the environment the
    inspected application runs in, such as the used Qt build, the standard paths and the
    environment variables.

    \section2 Qt Installation

    The \uicontrol Qt tab shows information about the Qt build used by the inspected application.
    This includes the version as well as information about the build configuration and architecture,
    as well as the installation location of Qt. You can also find details about the platform the
    application runs on (OS, version, architecture, etc) here. All information here is retrieved
    via QLibraryInfo and QSysInfo and therefore reflects Qt's view.

    \section2 Standard Paths

    The standard paths view provides access to the information of QStandardPaths. For each
    standard location (see QStandardPaths::StandardLocation) it shows the readable and writable
    locations as seen by the target process.

    \section2 Environment Variables

    The \uicontrol Environment tab shows a table of all environment variables and their corresponding
    value, as seen by QProcessEnvironment::systemEnvironment() in the target process.
