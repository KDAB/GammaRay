    \brief Geometry data inspection.
    \ingroup examples-gammaray

    This examples shows GammaRay's capabilities for inspecting \l{Qt 3D} vertex and index attribute
    data.

    \section1 Problem

    The example shows a three dimensional cylinder using \l{Qt 3D}. It's implemented as a custom
    Qt3DRender::QGeometry sub-class and computes the cylinder geometry, surface normals and
    vertex indexes.

    Looking at the rendered result we notice that one side of the cylinder is not rendered
    correctly, and on closer look we also see that the phong shading doesn't match the
    expected light reflections on a cylinder

    \section1 Investigation

    GammaRay provides several features supporting the analysis of issues regarding
    vertex data provided via Qt3DRender::QAttribute and Qt3DRender::QBuffer. They are all
    available by opening the \l{Qt3D Inspector} view, selecting a geometry entity in the entity
    tree view on the left side and then opening the \l{Qt3D Geometry Inspector} tab on the right side.

    \section2 Backface culling

    A common problem for seemingly "missing" parts of the geometry is a wrong vertex order.
    The \l{Qt3D Geometry Inspector} in GammaRay allows you to disable the normally active backface
    culling to easily spot such cases. You find the action for that in the toolbar above
    the geometry view.

    Back faces of triangles are rendered in red with culling disabled. Rotating the cylinder
    in our example using the middle mouse button so you can see the bottom disc will show
    that the triangles are indeed the wrong way around, and thus aren't rendred.

    \section2 Normal vector visualization

    With the geometry fixed, we can look into the shading issues. Light reflection in the
    phong model largely depends on surface normal vectors, which are also provided via
    a Qt3DRender::QAttribute in our example. Normals can be visualized with the \l{Qt3D Geometry Inspector}
    by choosing the corresponding action in the toolbar above the geometry view.
    The resulting blue lines show the vertex normals, the yellow lines the corresponding
    face normals.

    In our case we can easily see that the normals for the side faces are bent towards the
    center line of the cylinder, that is their y value isn't 0 for all vertices as it is
    supposed to be.
