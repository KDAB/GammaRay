    \title Problem Reporter

    \section1 Overview

    The problem reporter view can be found among the other inspection tools in the left sidebar. It is a central
    place to collect all issues in the target application that GammaRay observed while being attached. Additionally,
    it allows to scan the target application for a selected set of issues.

    The detected issues are found in the list view on the right side, including a description, a severity level
    of the issue (shown as icon), and if available the source location the issues originates in. A context menu
    allows navigating to the source location, as well as to the associated object.

    The left panel in the problem reporter controls explicit scans for issues. At the top various scans are listed
    and can be selected, the button below executes the scan. Note that this can take quite some time and can block
    the target application.
