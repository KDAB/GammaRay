    \title Qt Creator Integration

    \section1 Overview

    The GammaRay \l{Qt Creator} integration plug-in allows you to interact with a target application
    with GammaRay conveniently from within Qt Creator. The \l{GammaRay Client} is embedded inside Qt Creator
    in this case, and you can directly launch, attach to or connect to target applications using the currently
    active project configuration. Code navigation from GammaRay will directly open the corresponding source
    file inside Qt Creator.

    The GammaRay Qt Creator integration plug-in is only available in the \l{Qt Automotive Suite}.

    \section1 Launching Applications

    Launching a target application with GammaRay from within \l{Qt Creator} is as easy as starting it in the debugger.
    Just select \uicontrol Analyze > \uicontrol {Start with GammaRay}. Your target application will be started and the
    GammaRay client appears inside Qt Creator. All necessary configuration for GammaRay is automatically determined
    from the project settings in Qt Creator.

    The following remote targets are supported:
    \list
        \li Generic Linux targets using SSH
        \li QNX targets using SSH
        \li Linux Boot2Qt targets
    \endlist

    \section1 Attaching to an Application

    To attach to a locally running application select \uicontrol Analyze > \uicontrol {Attach GammaRay to a local running process}.
    This will show you the standard process selection dialog of \l{Qt Creator}. Select the process you want to attach
    to and press \uicontrol{Attach to Process}. After attaching the GammaRay client will be shown inside Qt Creator.

    \section1 Connecting to a Running Application

    It is also possible to connect to a target on a remote device that has already been injected with GammaRay.
    This option is available under \uicontrol{Analyze} > \uicontrol{Connect GammaRay to a remote running process}.
    Selecting this option will show the connection dialog depicted in the following screenshot.

    \image gammaray-qtcreator-connect.png

    GammaRay tries to automatically discover viable targets on your local network, these are displayed in the list view
    in this dialog, and can be used by selecting the corresponding items. Discovered targets using an incompatible
    GammaRay version will be shown but will be disabled for selection.

    Should GammaRay not be able to discover the desired target automatically, the network address of the target can also
    be specified manually in the entry field on the top. This might be necessary depending on your local network setup.
