    \title Getting Started

    \section1 Launching a New Application

    \section2 On the command line

    Launching an application with GammaRay on the command line is similar to tools like valgrind:
    \code
    gammaray <gammaray-args> <app> <app-args>
    \endcode

    This will launch the application with GammaRay attached to it right from the start. The GammaRay arguments allow you to select a different injection method.
    While the default is suitable for most target applications, the simultaneous use of other tools using the same entry points as GammaRay might require using alternative
    injection methods for example.

    \section2 With a graphical user interface

    Launching applications is also available in the graphical user interface. Launch GammaRay without command line arguments (or use the menu shortcut if you have one), select the \uicontrol Launch tab. There you can select the executable to launch as well as optional command line arguments to pass to it.

    \section2 On an embedded target

    If you want to run the GammaRay UI on a different machine, which is commonly the case for embedded targets, you can proceed as described in the command line section above, with the extra \c --inject-only argument passed to GammaRay. Then follow the instructions below on how to connect to a already running instance.

    \section1 Attaching to a Running Application

    \section2 On the command line

    Attaching to a running application on the command line is similar to gdb:
    \code
    gammaray <gammaray-args> --pid <pid>
    \endcode

    This will attach GammaRay to the application running with process id "<pid>". Keep in mind that this process has to be a Qt application with matching build settings and Qt version for GammaRay to work.

    \section2 With a graphical user interface

    Launch GammaRay without command line arguments (or use the menu shortcut if you have one) to bring up the GammaRay UI. It will show you a list of processes GammaRay can attach to, that is, those with the same build settings and Qt version as your GammaRay instance. You'll find the process list on the \uicontrol Attach tab.

    \section2 On an embedded target

    If you want to run the GammaRay UI on a different machine, which is commonly the case for embedded targets, you can proceed as described in the command line section above, with the extra \c --inject-only argument passed to GammaRay. Then follow the instructions below on how to connect to a already running instance.

    \section1 Connecting to a Running Application

    \section2 On the command line

    Run the following command to connect to a running remote instance:
    \code
    gammaray --connect tcp://<host>:<port>
    \endcode

    Insert the IP address or host name of the target device, and if needed the port number accordingly. The port number can usually be omitted if there's only a single GammaRay instance active on the target. The port number to use is printed on the command line after injection as described above.

    \section2 With a graphical user interface

    Launch GammaRay without any command line arguments to get to the launcher UI. Select the \uicontrol Connect tab. Depending on your network setup active targets will be already listed here and can simply be selected from the list. Manual entry of host name or IP address, and if necessary the port number is also possible.
