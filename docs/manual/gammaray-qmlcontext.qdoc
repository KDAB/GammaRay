    \title QML Context

    \section1 Overview

    The QML context view shows the chain of QQmlContext instances from the root context up to the
    context in which the current object has been created. The QML context view is available for any
    QObject instantiated from within QML.

    The QML context views consists of two parts, the context chain view on the top, and the context property
    view at the bottom. The context property view shows the currently selected context from the context chain
    view.

    \section2 Context Chain

    The context chain view shows the entire chain of QQmlContext instances starting from the root
    context in the first line. For each context, the corresponding QML file is displayed, as far
    as that information is known. The context menu allows you to navigate to the source code, opening
    it in your configured code editor.

    \section2 Context Properties

    For the selected context in the context chain view, the context properties view shows the properties
    of the corresponding QQmlContext object. This view essentially works like the general \l{Properties}
    view.
