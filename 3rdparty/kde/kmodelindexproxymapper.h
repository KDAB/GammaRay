/**
 * @brief This class facilitates easy mapping of indexes and selections through proxy models.
 *
 * In a complex system of proxy models there can be a need to map indexes and selections between them,
 * and sometimes to do so without knowledge of the path from one model to another.
 *
 * For example,
 *
 * @verbatim
 *     Root model
 *         |
 *       /    \
 *   Proxy 1   Proxy 3
 *      |       |
 *   Proxy 2   Proxy 4
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * If there is a need to map indexes between proxy 2 and proxy 4, a KModelIndexProxyMapper can be created
 * to facilitate mapping of indexes between them.
 *
 * @code
 *   m_indexMapper = new KModelIndexProxyMapper(proxy2, proxy4, this);
 *
 *  ...
 *
 *   const QModelIndex proxy4Index = m_mapLeftToRight(proxy2->index(0, 0));
 *   Q_ASSERT(proxy4Index.model() == proxy4);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note that the aim is to achieve black box connections so that there is no need for application code to
 * know the structure of proxy models in the path between left and right and attempt to manually map them.
 *
 * @verbatim
 *     Root model
 *         |
 *   ---------------
 *   |  Black Box  |
 *   ---------------
 *      |       |
 *   Proxy 2   Proxy 4
 * @endverbatim
