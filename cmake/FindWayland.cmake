# FindWayland
# -----------
#
# Try to find Wayland.
#
# This is a component-based find module, which makes use of the COMPONENTS
# and OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS arguments to find_module.  The following components
# are available::
#
#   Client  Server  Cursor  Egl
#
# If no components are specified, this module will act as though all components
# were passed to OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS.
#
# This module will define the following variables, independently of the
# components searched for or found:
#
# ``Wayland_FOUND``
#     TRUE if (the requested version of) Wayland is available
# ``Wayland_VERSION``
#     Found Wayland version
# ``Wayland_TARGETS``
#     A list of all targets imported by this module (note that there may be more
#     than the components that were requested)
# ``Wayland_LIBRARIES``
#     This can be passed to target_link_libraries() instead of the imported
#     targets
# ``Wayland_INCLUDE_DIRS``
#     This should be passed to target_include_directories() if the targets are
#     not used for linking
# ``Wayland_DEFINITIONS``
#     This should be passed to target_compile_options() if the targets are not
#     used for linking
#
# For each searched-for components, ``Wayland_<component>_FOUND`` will be set to
# TRUE if the corresponding Wayland library was found, and FALSE otherwise.  If
# ``Wayland_<component>_FOUND`` is TRUE, the imported target
# ``Wayland::<component>`` will be defined.  This module will also attempt to
# determine ``Wayland_*_VERSION`` variables for each imported target, although
# ``Wayland_VERSION`` should normally be sufficient.
#
# In general we recommend using the imported targets, as they are easier to use
# and provide more control.  Bear in mind, however, that if any target is in the
# link interface of an exported library, it must be made available by the
# package config file.
#
# Since pre-1.0.0.
