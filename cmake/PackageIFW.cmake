# Creates targets for IFW packages.
#
# Usage:
#  addPackageTarget(package_name build_target install_target package_type)
#
# Where:
# - package_name is the name of the package (application), like GammaRay
# - build_target is the name of the make target used to build the required code (eg. src, sub-src, lib, docs, etc)
# - install_target is the name of the make target used to install the required code (eg. install, install_docs, etc)
# - package_type is the type of the package. Should be one of lib, doc, examples, tools
#
#
# For each type there will be a target created, eg. packagelib, packagedoc, etc. and there will be
# a master target called packages. Running
#
#     make packages
#
# will create the 7z packages for all added targets.
